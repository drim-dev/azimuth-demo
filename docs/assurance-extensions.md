# Assurance extensions

Azimuth's small core contains claims, realization, evidence, mechanisms and judgment. External
tools extend those concepts; they do not add a facet or a tool category to the core (D39).

## Choose the binding by proposition

The executable does not determine the role. Ask what the result establishes.

| Result | Usual binding | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Load threshold over a declared workload | evidence | workload, threshold and measured outcome form an oracle |
| Stress, spike, soak or capacity threshold | evidence | each threshold is a claim-specific assertion |
| Chaos degradation, recovery or alert check | evidence | each observed predicate has its own oracle |
| Broad SAST/SARIF scan | challenge | absence of reported findings does not establish product behaviour |
| Mutation run | challenge | killed mutations qualify test sensitivity, not the expected result |
| Claim-specific static rule with independent oracle | evidence | its proposition is narrower than “the scanner passed” |
| Race detector, sanitizer or leak checker | challenge by default | a clean sampled run is negative search over executions |
| Contract or schema compatibility test | evidence | the accepted/rejected relation is the product predicate |
| Backup restoration or rollback drill | evidence | recovery time and restored invariants are observable claims |
| Penetration or exploratory session | evidence receipt or challenge | use evidence only for explicit executed cases and outcomes |

The same observation may have several bindings. One load execution can cover latency and error
rate; one chaos execution can cover degraded service, queue recovery and alert delivery. Each
binding declares a separate assertion, outcome, scope, quantification and oracle. There is no
blanket `passed` relation.

## Provider-neutral boundary

```json
{
  "observations": [{
    "id": "expected-load-42",
    "kind": "load-test",
    "tool": "k6",
    "tool_version": "1.0.0",
    "report": "reports/load.json",
    "inputs": ["tests/load.js"],
    "observed_at": "2026-08-11T12:00:00Z",
    "expires_at": 4102444800,

    "bindings": [{
      "role": "evidence",
      "spec": "checkout/performance",
      "scenario": "latency-objective",
      "assertion": "p95 latency is below 300 milliseconds",
      "outcome": "satisfied",
      "subjects": [],
      "scope": "e2e",

    }],

  }]
}
```

Adapters own native schemas and reject unknown versions or statuses. `azimuth-import-observation`
validates provider-neutral exports. `azimuth-import-mutation` and `azimuth-import-sarif` derive
challenge bindings from existing linkage so they need no second claim map.

The opaque payload is for agent inspection and export consumers. It cannot change a binding's role,
outcome or form; those remain explicit core fields. The payload and native inputs are covered by the
observation fingerprint.

## Repository placement

An observation belongs to the repository or assurance system that produces its immutable result.
Realization and evidence may be in another repository from intent. For example:

- an application repository emits the backlog metric;
- an operations repository owns the Prometheus rule and `promtool` rule test;
- an assurance repository owns a broker-loss experiment and alert-delivery receipt;
- one model source remains authority for the operational claim.

Checked-in rules establish declared configuration. They do not establish that production loaded
the rule, scraped the metric or delivered the notification. Claims about those boundaries require a
live observation or a composed revision-bound receipt.

## Extension acceptance test

A new adapter is composable when it can be added without a Rust tool type and satisfies all of:

- native schema and status vocabulary fail closed;
- every evidence proposition is an explicit binding with a complete form;
- broad analysis creates no implicit coverage;
- challenge subjects resolve to existing linkage and fail after deletion or rename;
- report, configuration or subject changes stale affected judgments;
- one execution may bind to several claims without duplicating run metadata.

The executable fixtures are under `experiments/assurance-extensions/`.
