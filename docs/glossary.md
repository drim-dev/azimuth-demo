# Glossary

Bounded definitions. Several terms here are borrowed from fields with established formal
meanings — proof, universal, quantification, evidence. **Where a term is borrowed, the entry
states how this framework's use is narrower than the original.** That narrowing is deliberate:
precise vocabulary is only an asset while the model behaves the way the vocabulary implies. A
term that writes a cheque the model cannot cash costs more credibility than it buys.

If a document uses one of these words in a different sense, the document is wrong.

## The claim model

**Claim** — a proposition about the system that is either satisfied or not, carrying a stable id.
`claim = (domain, predicate)`. The unit of coverage: everything the framework checks is checked
per claim.

**Predicate** — what must hold. Written in prose. *Narrowing:* not a formal predicate. It has no
machine-checkable semantics; its truth is established by evidence, not by evaluation. This is the
single largest gap between the framework's vocabulary and formal methods, and it is why no
mechanism here ever claims to establish truth.

**Domain** — what a claim ranges over. Six values: executions of a behaviour, a set of sites, the
code artifact itself, paired derivations that must agree, aggregate state over time, eventual
absence. Closed set for now (D13.3).

**Quantifier** — deliberately absent. Every claim is universal; a constant field carries no
information (D13). The only existential statements are marginal capability claims.

**Spec** — a named group of requirements with a declared, path-independent id. Organized by
domain area, never by service.

**Requirement** — a single normative SHALL rule, carrying criticality. Groups scenarios. The unit
at which rigor is declared.

**Scenario** — a claim in GIVEN/WHEN/THEN form. The unit of coverage. Ids are unique per spec,
not per requirement, so that splitting or merging a requirement touches no tags.

**Criticality** — `critical` | `standard` | `routine`. Declared on every requirement; absence is
a hole, not a default. Determines which artifacts are required at all, not merely how strong the
evidence must be (D6.5, D20). Routine stops at intent and owes no linkage; standard and critical
propagate to code along `realizes` edges. Criticality is never a property of a directory and may
change through a change without changing claim identity (D21.1).

## Facets

**Facet** — one of the three things that can be said about a claim. Missing facets relative to the
declared rigor generate the basic completeness holes (D3, D20). Incomplete facets, cross-facet
consistency and enumerator machinery generate further findings; the stronger claim that facet
presence generates the whole taxonomy has been partially falsified.

**Intent** — what must be true, over what domain, and how much it matters. Recorded in the spec.

**Mechanism** — what makes it true, and how strongly. Recorded in the design artifact.

**Evidence** — how we know it is true, and how freshly. Recorded in the verification plan.

**Residue** — everything that belongs to no claim: orientation, danger zones, deliberately broken
corners, what is absent and why. Outside the model, in no check, and underivable by anything.
Named so that the design artifact does not become a dumping ground.

---

## Evidence

**Evidence** — anything that supports belief in a claim: tests, static rules, type and schema
constraints, DB constraints, model checks, fault injection, canary metrics, production monitors,
manual passes, third-party attestation. *Narrowing:* not evidence in the legal or Bayesian sense;
no weight is combined or accumulated across items.

**Strength** — how far the evidence reaches:

- **Proof** — established by construction over all executions. *Narrowing:* far weaker than the
  formal-methods sense. No obligation is discharged and no semantics is checked; the predicate
  remains prose. A unique index, a type constraint, or a static rule is proof-strength here
  because violation is unrepresentable, not because anything was proved.
- **Demonstration** — held for the executions sampled. All tests, including property tests: a
  wider sample, still a sample.
- **Detection** — we would learn if it stopped holding. Monitors, reconciliation jobs, alerts.
  A claim about the *detector*, never about the property.

**Quantification** — `example` | `universal`: whether evidence checked one case or ranges over
all of them. A property of evidence, not of the claim. This is property-based testing's
example/property cut, named on the *breadth of the evidence* rather than on the predicate under
test — the framework accepts derived enumeration, generation and repeated contention as satisfying
it, and only one of the three is a property test. *Narrowing:* `universal` names the quantifier the
evidence ranges under, not exhaustiveness; a generated or interleaved space is a wider sample and
still a sample (see **Demonstration**). *(revised — the value was `invariant` until D19, which
renamed it because a Floyd or Meyer invariant is a predicate about the system, and this field is
about the evidence. `invariant` is now no value of this field at all. The word survives here only
as the alpha's name for a cross-cutting rule, which in this framework is a claim with a non-default
domain, and in `invariant-breach`, the hole kind for a member of such a domain that discharges
nothing.)*

**Scope** — `unit` | `component` | `e2e`, defined by what must be *real*, not by how much runs
(D15). Applies to demonstration-strength evidence only: a static rule executes nothing and has no
scope; a monitor has a target.

**Oracle** — how the expected result was obtained: `direct`, `golden`, `metamorphic`,
`model-based`, `contract`. Descriptive, never gated.

**Freshness** — what re-establishes an evidence item and how often, plus how it dies silently. A
test is re-established every CI run; an attestation ages out; a monitor whose query broke has
fired zero times for six months and is worse than no monitor, because it is carried on the books.

**Evidence receipt** — an attributable result imported from a system of record. A manual receipt
names the external case and run, outcome, observation instant, expiry, evidence form and immutable
payload fingerprint. Only a current pass contributes coverage; failure and expiry are holes.

**Detector test** — a test proving that a detection-strength item actually fires: that the
reconciliation job flags an injected imbalance, that the deletion scan flags a planted record.
Required for every detection item (D4.3). This is what makes liveness claims checkable before
release.

**Residual risk** — what is knowingly not covered, and why that is acceptable. A first-class
field, because with mixed evidence "covered" stops being binary.

---

## Mechanism

**Enforcement strength** — a ladder, strongest first: unrepresentable (type/schema) >
structurally unbypassable (choke point, DB constraint) > centrally applied but opt-in
(middleware) > guard at every site.

The top two rungs **are** proof-strength evidence — strong enforcement is self-evidencing. The
bottom two are enforcement that proves nothing on its own (D7).

**Choke point** — a single place a violation would have to pass through. Contrast with a guard at
every site, which is the design that leaks.

---

## Linkage

**Tag** — a machine-readable annotation on code or a test, naming the claim it relates to by
`(spec-id, scenario-id)`. Required only for standard and critical claims. Absence opts an artifact
out of Azimuth linkage; a routine claim owes no linkage.

**`realizes`** — on a production mechanism: this site is on that claim's path. A site may be
application code or declared delivery topology when routing is part of the behavior. It carries no
form; form is how a test checks, not a property of production mechanism.

**`covers`** — on a test: this test verifies that claim, at this *actual* scope and
quantification. The required form lives in the verification plan; `covers` declares what the test
really is, and the comparison is what produces `wrong-form`.

**Enumerator** — what produces the member set for a claim ranging over a set of sites. Must be
derived from the same source the system is built from — the route table, the DI container, the
type graph. A hand-listed surface is worse than no rule, because it reproduces the very bug the
rule prevents and reports green (D13.1). It enumerates domain members, not the semantic requirements
each member realizes.

**Design binding** — a machine-addressable compiler or schema artifact named by a current design
mechanism. Resolution establishes existence. Only properties emitted independently—currently index
uniqueness, columns and predicates—can establish more.

**Delivery topology** — the exchange, bindings, durable queues and dead-letter routes that connect
a brokered producer to its consumers. It is a realization site because correct endpoint code with a
missing binding does not realize delivery. Source declarations establish requested topology; a
deployment-side enumerator is needed to establish what an environment actually deployed (D26).

**Exemption** — a deliberate, attributable, reviewable opt-out from an obligation. Fine anywhere;
a silent absence from an obligation is not. An untagged test asserts no Azimuth evidence, so it has
nothing to be exempted from (D20.1).

---

## Findings

**Hole** — a finding. The basic completeness holes are missing-facet combinations relative to
criticality:

| Facets present | Hole |
|---|---|
| intent, no mechanism | **unrealized** |
| intent, no evidence | **uncovered** |
| evidence, no intent | **dangling tag** |
| mechanism, no intent | **dangling realization** (rogue complexity) |
| intent + evidence below the declared standard | **wrong-form** |

Incomplete facets, cross-facet consistency, agent judgments and **enumerator unsound or underived**
(D13.2) add findings not generated by facet presence. Their existence partially fired D3's recorded
falsifier; they do not by themselves establish a fourth facet.

---

## Tooling and process

**Change** — the temporal envelope from an accepted current model to a proposed target model.
Carries intent deltas, solution design where needed, implementation work and verification
obligations. Proposed facts do not become current facts until completion (D21).

**Archive** — the immutable semantic record of a completed, rejected or abandoned change. A
completed change updates the current facets before it is archived; a rejected or abandoned one
updates none.

**Finalization** — the derived model fingerprint and check summary for an accepted, applied change.
It gates the mechanical archive move and contains no authored risk decision.

**Machine tier** — the deterministic checks. Finds structural holes. Cannot be argued with, and
cannot establish truth.

**Agent tier** — the judgment pass: is a test toothy, is a tag honest, is a required behaviour
missing from the spec. A judgment is evidence about evidence, never evidence of the claim; its
negative verdicts create holes and its fingerprint expires when the comparison it examined changes
(D18).

**Export** — the derived model, serialized. Checks, dashboards, PR annotations and the agent tier
are all consumers of it; nothing re-parses specs.

**Check** — one derivation over the model or over the code, with a stable public id. `rtm` is one
check among several, not the product.

**Change** — the unit in which intent, mechanism and evidence move together. The natural review
boundary and the natural unit for the adoption ratchet.

**Steel thread** — one scenario carried end to end through every layer before any breadth, so
that the fan-out exists in week one.

**Fan-out** — one claim realized at several sites across components and languages. The reason
specs are organized by domain area rather than by service.
