# Azimuth — what the framework is

Status: **derived**. This document states the framework as it currently stands. It is assembled
from [`decisions.md`](./decisions.md), [`glossary.md`](./glossary.md), the three facet READMEs and
[`tools/azimuth/README.md`](../tools/azimuth/README.md); where it disagrees with any of them, they
win and this file is wrong. Terminology is bounded by the glossary.

It exists because those documents describe the framework by *decision* and by *facet*, and nothing
described it as a whole. A decision log records how a design was argued into existence, not what it
is now — several entries are marked *(revised)* or *(supersedes …)*, so reading it end to end gives
the history rather than the current state.

For whether any of this is *established*, see [`status.md`](./status.md). This document says what
the framework claims; that one says how much of it has survived contact with evidence.

## The central claim

**A requirement has three possible facets: what must be true, what makes it true, and how we know
(D3).** Recording only the first is what specification practice does today; recording the first and
third is what a traceability matrix does. The framework's bet is that the second is load-bearing
where assurance is required. Criticality sets that boundary: a routine claim deliberately stops at
intent, while standard and critical claims activate linkage and evidence (D20).

The consequence that makes this checkable rather than editorial: **holes begin with facets that are
missing relative to the declared rigor**, so a finding is a structural fact about the model rather
than a matter of taste (D3, D20). Other finding kinds qualify incomplete facets, cross-facet
consistency and the machinery that enumerates a claim's domain; D3's stronger taxonomy claim has
already been partially falsified.

---

## Five primitives

Everything else is structure layered over these, and D8 requires each layer to be removable without
breaking the core (§0.1 of `decisions.md`):

1. **Claims** — stable ids, criticality, the domain they range over (D13), and three facets (D3).
2. **Tags** — `realizes` and `covers`, binding code and tests to standard and critical claims.
3. **Evidence** — carrying strength and freshness (D4).
4. **The derived model** over the above, exported (D10).
5. **Changes** — the unit in which all of it moves (D11).

A claim is `(domain, predicate)`. The predicate is prose: it has no machine-checkable semantics,
and its truth is established by evidence rather than by evaluation. That is the largest gap between
this vocabulary and formal methods, and it is why no mechanism here claims to establish truth.

Every claim is universal. There is no quantifier field, because a constant field carries no
information (D13).

## The three facets

| Facet | Records | Lives in | Keys on |
|---|---|---|---|
| Intent | what must be true, over what domain, how much it matters | `specs/` | scenario |
| Mechanism | what makes it true, and how strongly | `design/` | requirement |
| Evidence | how we know, and how freshly | `verification/` | scenario |

**Intent.** A spec is a named group of requirements; a requirement is one SHALL rule carrying
criticality; a scenario is a claim in GIVEN/WHEN/THEN form. Scenario ids are unique per spec rather
than per requirement, which is what makes splitting or merging a requirement free — scenarios move
between parents without touching a tag. Ids are declared in headings and never derived from paths,
so moving a file breaks nothing (`specs/README.md`).

**Mechanism.** An entry names a specific artifact — an index, a type, a choke point — and asserts
that it is what holds the claim up. Nothing structural is written, because anything a machine could
derive from the code and the tags does not belong there. This is what makes a design document
checkable instead of believable: when the code stops matching, that is a hole rather than stale
prose (`design/README.md`). Entries key on the requirement because one index typically makes every
scenario under it true at once.

**Evidence.** A plan records what *would be sufficient* to believe a claim, never what currently
exists — existing evidence is derived from `covers` tags, and hand-listing it would create a second
copy that drifts (D4.5). A claim with no plan entry is not unplanned; it means the project standard
applies unmodified.

**Residue** is the fourth thing in `design/` and is deliberately outside the model: orientation,
danger zones, deliberately broken corners, what is absent and why. It participates in no check and
is derivable by nothing. It is named explicitly so the design file does not become a dumping
ground, and it is distinct from a verification *residual*, which records missing evidence. The
first is knowledge; the second is a gap.

---

## Changes and archive

The three facets describe accepted current state. A **change** proposes a target state: intent
deltas, solution design where needed, implementation work and verification obligations. The target
is the current model with those deltas applied; current checks do not treat planned facts as facts
about the running system (D21).

Change design and current design have different lifetimes. `changes/<id>/design.md` may name
alternatives, components and mechanisms that do not exist yet. `design/<spec-id>.md` may name only
mechanisms that were actually built and currently support accepted claims. Completion distils the
current facets from the result and archives the whole change—including rejected alternatives,
departures and work—as the semantic record of the transition.

Criticality changes through the same lifecycle without changing claim identity. A raise derives
new linkage, mechanism and evidence obligations; a lowering records why those obligations no longer
apply and what would raise the requirement again. The provisional manual protocol is in
`changes/README.md`. Its syntax is deliberately not part of the framework yet: one measured feature
must use it before the parser or archive command is designed (D21.3).

---

## Linkage

Two tags, both keyed on the pair `(spec-id, scenario-id)`:

- **`realizes`**, on production code: this site is on that claim's path. Carries no form, because
  form is how a test checks and not a property of code.
- **`covers`**, on a test: this test verifies that claim, at this *actual* scope and
  quantification. The plan states the *required* form; comparing the two is what produces
  `wrong-form`.

Both are declarations at the tagged site and required from the claim side only at `standard` and
`critical`. A routine claim owes neither. A test with no `covers` tag is an ordinary test outside
Azimuth's evidence model, not an exemption and not a hole (D20.1).

**Fan-out** — one claim realized at several sites, across components and languages — is the reason
specs are organized by domain area rather than by service. Mirroring services would duplicate every
cross-component claim.

**Exemption** is a deliberate, attributable, reviewable opt-out from an obligation. An untagged
test claims no Azimuth evidence and therefore needs no exemption (D6.3, D20.1).

**Enumerator** — for a claim ranging over a set of sites, whatever produces the member set must be
derived from the same source the system is built from: the route table, the DI container, the type
graph. A hand-listed surface is worse than no rule, because it reproduces the bug the rule prevents
and reports green (D13.1).

---

## Evidence, and what is required

Evidence carries **strength**, and the ladder is `detection < demonstration < proof`:

- **Proof** — violation is unrepresentable. *Narrowing:* far weaker than the formal-methods sense.
  No obligation is discharged and no semantics is checked; the predicate is still prose. A unique
  index or a type constraint is proof-strength here because violation cannot be expressed, not
  because anything was proved.
- **Demonstration** — held for the executions sampled. Every test, including property tests: a
  wider sample is still a sample.
- **Detection** — we would learn if it stopped holding. A claim about the *detector*, never about
  the property, and every detection item needs a detector test proving it fires on an injected
  violation (D4.3).

**Scope** is `unit | component | e2e`, defined by what must be *real* rather than by how much runs
(D15). It applies to demonstration-strength evidence only: a static rule executes nothing and has
no scope. Defining it this way makes the rung partly machine-checkable — a harness knows whether it
started a database.

**Quantification** is `example | universal`: whether the evidence checked one case or ranges over
all of them. It is a property of evidence, not of the claim. The value was `invariant` until D19
renamed it, because a Floyd or Meyer invariant is a predicate about the *system* and this field
reports the breadth of the *evidence*. *Narrowing:* `universal` states the quantifier the evidence
ranges under, not exhaustiveness — a wider sample is still a sample.

**Oracle** — `direct | golden | metamorphic | model-based | contract` — is descriptive and never
gated.

The project standard (`verification/standards.md`) maps criticality to required evidence once,
rather than per claim:

| Level | Strength | Quantification | Residual |
|---|---|---|---|
| `critical` | demonstration | universal | required |
| `standard` | demonstration | example | optional |
| `routine` | none | — | optional |

Default scope is `unit` for every claim, raised per claim where the claim's truth depends on
something real. Scope is deliberately *not* derived from criticality: an authorization rule can be
critical and honestly unit-checkable, while a `standard` claim about concurrent writes is vacuous
at unit scope. What determines scope is what the claim is about, not how much it matters.

Ladders mean a required form is a floor, not a target: proof satisfies a demonstration
requirement, and `universal` satisfies an `example` one.

---

## Mechanism, and why strength is never written

Enforcement kinds form a ladder (D7), strongest first:

| Rung | Kind | Violation is | Derived strength |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `type`, `schema` | unrepresentable | proof |
| 2 | `constraint`, `choke-point` | rejected by storage, or routed through one place | proof |
| 3 | `middleware` | prevented where applied; application is opt-in | demonstration required |
| 4 | `guard` | checked at each site | demonstration required |

Strength is derived from the kind and never declared, because writing it would duplicate a
derivable fact. The top two rungs **are** proof-strength evidence — strong enforcement is
self-evidencing — which is why a claim enforced at rung 1 or 2 may carry a weaker evidence
requirement without that being a bargain.

The bottom rung is the design that leaks. "A guard at every site" is the weakest thing that can
still be called enforcement, and checking it means enumerating a set, which is where the machine
tier is weakest and D13.1's enumerator problem appears.

## Findings

Most hole kinds are missing-facet combinations, which is D3's central structural claim:

| Facets present | Hole |
|---|---|
| intent, no mechanism | `unrealized` |
| intent, no evidence | `uncovered` |
| evidence, no intent | `dangling-tag` |
| mechanism, no intent | `dangling-realization` |
| intent + evidence below the declared standard | `wrong-form` |

Four are **not** missing-facet: `unclassified`, `unaccepted-weakening`, `undeclared-mechanism` and
`unjudged` are *incomplete*-facet — the facet is present but a required part of it is missing. This
is recorded as a partial falsifier of D3: the premise fires, the conclusion does not, since none of
the four implies a fourth facet. D3 has not been amended.

Whether *only* these four count against the falsifier is unsettled. Read strictly, several other
kinds are also not missing-facet combinations — `unbacked-proof` is a cross-facet consistency
check, the agent-tier kinds qualify evidence rather than record its absence, and `invariant-breach`
and `dangling-class` concern a claim's machinery, which the glossary already carves out for
`enumerator unsound or underived` (D13.2). The four above are the ones the source marks as
incomplete-facet in so many words. The wider reading would make D3's falsifier fire far harder, and
nothing has decided between them.

Two tiers produce findings:

- The **machine tier** is deterministic. It finds structural holes, cannot be argued with, and
  cannot establish truth.
- The **agent tier** judges what the machine cannot: whether a test is toothy, whether a tag is
  honest, whether a required behaviour is missing from the spec. Its outputs are evidence items at
  demonstration strength, never proof, with freshness re-established when the subgraph they judged
  changes (D14, revised by D18). A judgment whose evidence has changed is reported as
  `stale-judgment` rather than silently trusted — which is why a refactor invalidates prior
  verification by fingerprint rather than by anyone remembering.

## The tool

`azimuth` is the tool. `rtm` is one check among several, and the matrix is not the product (D9).

```
azimuth check                    # all checks
azimuth check rtm --only '…/**'  # one check, scoped by id
azimuth export --out model.json
```

Exit codes: `0` clean, `1` errors found, `2` the model could not be derived. Selection operates on
ids rather than paths, so it survives a reorganization. Severity comes from criticality, not from
the check (D9.2), and check ids are a public interface (D9.1).

The core is dependency-free (D17) and reads only **manifests**, never source. One extractor per
ecosystem finds tags in its own language and writes the same language-neutral manifest; that seam
is why adding a language is a day's work rather than a fork of the core. Extractors exist for .NET
and TypeScript.

The export is a first-class artifact (D10): checks, dashboards, PR annotations and the agent tier
are all consumers of it, and nothing re-parses specs.

**Machine-checkable design boundary.** Design entries bind to compiler/schema artifacts. The tool
confirms .NET symbol existence and compares migration-derived index uniqueness, ordered columns and
predicates. It does not infer “only caller,” shared transaction or semantic correctness from a
symbol. Non-test evidence remains trusted at its declared strength; that is the agent tier's job.
Crediting a choke point still needs call-graph analysis in the extractor (D10.1), so
`invariant-breach` verifies only the weakest rung of the ladder — a guard at every site.

---

## Decided, proposed, open

**Decided for this phase** — everything above, and reopenable by evidence from the fixture rather
than by argument. D20 makes routine claims intent-only and D21 restores changes and archives as the
transition around the three current-state facets.

**Experimental.** Additive changes are projected and accepted archives are automated after two
manual lifecycle observations. Other delta operations and rejected/abandoned archive automation
remain absent. A general typed realization graph remains a proposal: the route experiment showed
that derived surface membership does not imply semantic requirement discovery.

**Open.** Six of the seven questions recorded in `decisions.md` remain open — question 3 was closed
by D15 — and they are open because they need evidence from the fixture, not more argument: id
semantics under split and merge; what realizes a scenario across a message broker; what `realizes`
means for a rule with no site; what is tagged when enforcement is a DB constraint; whether the
six-domain set is right and should stay closed (D13.3); how a generated check judges a domain whose
members discharge differently.

**Explicit non-goals for this phase** include backward compatibility, migrations and semver;
dashboards as deliverables (the export seam is the deliverable); and a configuration language for
rigor levels.

## What would falsify this

Recorded before the evidence existed. `status.md` holds the current results; two have fired.

| Falsifier | Status |
|---|---|
| >40% of requirements at top criticality → the level mechanism is theatre | **fired** (54%) |
| A hole kind that is not a missing-facet combination → D3 incomplete | **fired**, four times, and possibly harder — see above |
| The three role views over the export turn out identical → the facet split is decorative | never tested |
| Artifact and annotation cost exceeds what the defects justify → ceremony | never measured |
| The agent tier cannot reliably detect a dishonest tag → the core claim fails | inconclusive |
| A concern fits none of the six domains → D13 wrong | holds; two domains exercised |

## Prior art, conceded

Traceability matrices, assurance cases, architecture conformance checking and mutation testing all
overlap this work, and the overlap is substantial rather than incidental. Traceability matrices
already link requirements to tests; assurance cases already record structured argument from claim
to evidence; conformance checking already compares an asserted architecture against code.

The claim to novelty is narrow, and only one part of it currently survives contact with evidence:
**a claim quantified over a set of sites is not established by evidence about one site, however
good that evidence is** — and per-scenario tracing structurally cannot notice the difference. That
is demonstrated once, by its author, in `verification/trips/rider-view.md`. Everything beyond it is
unmeasured.

## What is not claimed

Nothing here establishes truth. The predicate is prose, `proof` means only that violation is
unrepresentable, and the agent tier is a judgment pass whose output is demonstration-strength at
best. The framework's output is a structured account of what is claimed, what holds it up and how
it is known — together with a machine-checkable list of the places that account is incomplete.
