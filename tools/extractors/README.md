# Extractors

One per ecosystem. Each finds the linkage tags in its own language and writes the same
language-neutral manifest; the core only ever reads manifests.

That seam is why adding a language is a day's work rather than a fork of the core — and it is what
lets the core stay dependency-free (D17) while this side does metadata and AST work in ecosystems
where that tooling is already present and idiomatic.

## Manifest

Keyed on the pair `(spec, scenario)`, not the alpha's triple (D2.2). Scenario ids are unique per
spec, so a requirement id would be redundant information that can go stale — and dropping it is
what makes splitting or merging a requirement free, since no tag moves.

```json
{
  "realizes": [{ "spec": "", "scenario": "", "site": "", "file": "", "lang": "",
                 "source_fingerprint": "" }],
  "covers":   [{ "spec": "", "scenario": "", "site": "", "file": "", "lang": "",
                 "source_fingerprint": "",
                 "scope": "unit|component|e2e",
                 "quantification": "example|universal",
                 "oracle": "direct|golden|relational|metamorphic|model-based|contract" }],
  "mechanism_implementations": [
    { "spec": "", "mechanism": "", "binding": "", "file": "", "lang": "",
      "source_fingerprint": "" }
  ],
  "mechanism_covers": [
    { "spec": "", "mechanism": "", "site": "", "file": "", "lang": "",
      "source_fingerprint": "", "scope": "unit|component|e2e",
      "quantification": "example|universal",
      "oracle": "direct|golden|relational|metamorphic|model-based|contract" }
  ],
  "enumerations": [{ "class": "", "kind": "", "source": "",
                     "source_fingerprint": "" }],
  "class_members": [{ "class": "", "site": "", "file": "", "lang": "" }],
  "artifacts": [{ "id": "", "kind": "", "file": "" }]
}
```

External tools use an `observations` collection. One immutable execution carries producer, report,
configuration inputs and fingerprint once; explicit bindings interpret it per claim. `evidence`
bindings project into `covers`. `challenge` bindings become agent judgment context and never cover
a claim. This many-to-many boundary avoids one core collection per tool and avoids repeating one
execution receipt for every claim.

`realizes` carries no form: form is how a test checks, not a property of code. The core rejects a
`realizes` that carries one, and rejects any entry carrying `req`, rather than ignoring it — a
stale emitter must not be able to produce tags that look fine and are not.

`source_fingerprint` hashes the compiler-resolved enclosing symbol or test. Judgment freshness uses
it to distinguish a changed evidence site from an unrelated edit in a shared file. It is optional:
when an extractor cannot resolve a site, the core conservatively hashes the complete file.

An enumeration witness says where a class came from independently of linkage tags. Its members are
authoritative only when the source was read completely; a missing build output or unresolved member
fails emission. Artifacts are exact binding targets for current design entries.

`mechanism_implementations` derives a concrete binding from a tag referring to an independent
design mechanism id. `mechanism_covers` records tests of that mechanism's contract. Neither array
is claim linkage, and mechanism evidence is never promoted automatically into `covers`.

## dotnet

Reflects over built assemblies. Running after a build rather than scanning source is deliberate:
reflection resolves inheritance and generics that a text scan gets wrong, and a tag the compiler
rejected is not a tag. Source paths come from the portable PDB, best-effort — an assembly without
one emits no paths and says so, rather than inventing them.

The .NET extractor also emits type/method symbols and executes compiled EF migration metadata to
derive database indexes, including uniqueness, ordered columns and predicates. It does not infer
that a method is an exclusive choke point.

```
azimuth-emit-dotnet --output m.json --root . path/to/Assembly.dll
```

## typescript

Static scan over the compiler API. The front end is functions, not classes, so the tags are typed
no-op function calls rather than decorators; the emitter resolves each call's enclosing named
symbol as the site, which makes a `covers` inside `test('…')` name the test.
The same AST node is the source-fingerprint boundary.

```
azimuth-emit-ts --output m.json --root . src
```

`--next-app <class>=<dir>` derives route members from Next's built route manifest. The option fails
closed when the build manifest is absent or a route cannot be resolved to project source.

`--prometheus <rules.yml>,<rules.test.yml>` emits `prometheus-alert:<name>` and
`prometheus-rule-test:<name>` artifacts. The repository runs `promtool test rules` before emission;
the extractor supplies machine addresses after Prometheus has validated the files, not a substitute
YAML interpretation. An immediately preceding `# azimuth-realizes: <spec> <scenario>` or
`# azimuth-covers: <spec> <scenario> <scope> <quantification> <oracle>` comment opts the named rule
or rule-test case into claim linkage. Federated source identity distinguishes `prometheus-alert`
from `prometheus-rule-test`; sharing the alert name does not make them one artifact.

The same compiler parser accepts `.js`, `.jsx`, `.mjs` and `.cjs` and emits `lang: javascript`.
JavaScript is an explicit mode of this extractor, not a copied text scanner.

## Go, JVM, Python, Rust and C++

The polyglot conformance experiment adds five extractor paths and language-native annotation
packages:

- Go uses typed no-op calls resolved against the enclosing Go AST function.
- Java and Kotlin use repeatable runtime annotations read from compiled JVM classes. Source lookup
  fails on ambiguity; fingerprints conservatively cover the complete source file.
- Python uses no-op decorators parsed by the standard `ast` module.
- Rust uses inert procedural attributes, requires the crate to compile, and binds attributes to
  their enclosing function in the source accepted by that build.
- C++ uses `clang::annotate`; the extractor consumes Clang's semantic AST rather than matching
  macros as text. Its fingerprint conservatively covers the complete source file.

`experiments/polyglot/check.sh` builds seven services, runs their evidence, emits seven manifests
through six extractor implementations and proves that their union closes one unchanged Azimuth
model.

### External manual results

`azimuth-import-manual <export.json> <manifest.json>` converts a provider-neutral manual-run export
into covering evidence receipts. A TestRail, Qase, Zephyr or similar adapter maps its API response
to this boundary:

```json
{
  "provider": "testrail",
  "run_id": "run-7",
  "observed_at": "2026-08-08T01:00:00Z",
  "expires_at": "2026-09-08T01:00:00Z",
  "results": [{
    "case_id": "case-42",
    "spec": "payments/capture",
    "scenario": "receipt-explains-payment-state",
    "status": "passed",
    "scope": "e2e",
    "quantification": "example",
    "url": "https://tracker.example/runs/7#42"
  }]
}
```

Only `passed` and `failed` cross the boundary; provider-specific states must be mapped explicitly.
The importer preserves failures, result attribution, observation time, expiry and a payload
fingerprint. A failed or expired receipt is a hole and does not count as coverage. A charter or test
case without an executed result emits nothing.

### Assurance observations

`azimuth-import-observation` validates the provider-neutral boundary used by load, chaos, recovery
and other execution adapters. Every evidence binding declares its own assertion, outcome, scope,
quantification and oracle. A shared run-level `passed` bit is rejected.

`azimuth-import-sarif` consumes SARIF 2.1.0. It intersects analyzed artifacts with existing
`Realizes` sites and emits one challenge binding per affected claim. Findings remain in the
fingerprinted payload; a clean scan creates judgment context, not claim evidence.

### Mutation challenge

`azimuth-import-mutation` consumes a Stryker mutation-testing-elements schema v2 JSON report, an
ordinary linkage manifest and the exact Stryker configuration:

```sh
azimuth-import-mutation report.json linkage.json mutation.json \
  --root . --config tests/stryker-config.json --tool-version 4.16.0
```

The adapter derives bindings by intersecting selected test names with existing `Covers` sites and
mutated files with existing `Realizes` sites, avoiding a second hand-maintained map. Its payload
carries every final mutant-state count and review metadata for non-killed executable mutants.
Unknown schemas or statuses fail closed. A renamed target or test becomes an
`unresolved-observation-binding` hole. Survivors do not automatically fail `azimuth check`: only the
agent can decide whether a generated wrong implementation is relevant to the claim.

## Linkage opt-in

`covers` opts a test into the evidence model. An untagged test emits nothing: it may exercise
routine behavior, infrastructure or a project rule that no Azimuth claim names. `uncovered` is
derived in the other direction, from a standard or critical claim with no sufficient evidence.
Likewise, mechanism markers participate only when a design declares the named identity; orphaned
implementation or evidence markers are dangling holes.

## Tests

```
dotnet test tools/extractors/dotnet/Azimuth.Emit.Tests
(cd tools/extractors/typescript && npx tsc -p tsconfig.json && node --test dist/emitter.test.js)
```

Each extractor has a synthetic fixture beside it, synthetic by decision (D2): the moment an
extractor's tests assert against the real demo app, the two are welded together and neither can
move independently.

The tests assert on the *shape* of what is emitted rather than merely that something was, because
a silently wrong emitter produces a green matrix — the exact failure the framework exists to
prevent. The .NET suite includes a regression for the enum-boxing bug that first emitted
`"scope": "1"` instead of `"component"`.
